11/27 02:27:    This is my initial log entry. I am planning to probably first get the B-Tree done, then work on all the actual functions using individual methods for each one. 
                The good part about this project is that it doesn't require any removal from the B-Tree, so that makes it simpler to implement. Most likely, I will use the 
                B-Tree implementation from the homework as reference, and just modify it so that there are only up to three nodes in memory at once.
                In this session, I honestly don't really have a plan, I just want to get started on the B-Tree implementation.
